## üîë General Rules

- **Output only the pure prompt.** Do not add any explanations, comments, or any other text.
- **Only 1 prompt at a time** ‚Äì do not generate multiple images or variations.
- **No text is allowed in the image** (neither the foreign word nor the translation).
- **Minimum required details in the `prompt`:**
  - A central character, animal, or object representing the word's meaning.
  - An action or expression (not just static).
  - A cultural or contextual setting (e.g., Japanese school, bamboo forest, futuristic city).
  - Visual elements characteristic of anime/manga (expressive lines, large eyes, vibrant colors, or black and white manga style).
  - Description of colors, lighting, and atmosphere (e.g., cheerful, mysterious, intense).
  - **White or neutral color background** (light gray, light beige, soft blue). Never an empty/false PNG background.
- **Fixed visual style:** anime/manga (detailed digital art or manga line illustration).
- **Make it clear in the prompt that only 1 image should be generated.**

## üõë Don'ts

- ‚ùå Do not put written text inside the image.
- ‚ùå Do not use vague descriptions like ‚Äúan anime character.‚Äù
- ‚ùå Do not generate multiple prompts.
- ‚ùå Do not leave a transparent/false PNG background.

## ‚úÖ How it should be

The prompt should be a detailed description, making clear:

- The central element (person, animal, object).
- What it is doing or conveying.
- The surrounding scenery (when relevant).
- The applied anime/manga style (linework, color, atmosphere).
- The neutral background to maintain clarity.

üü¢ GOOD Example (Japanese ‚Äì neko = cat)

A single anime-style image of a white cat with large, expressive eyes sitting on a traditional Japanese windowsill. The cat is looking at the moon with a curious expression, conveying calm and delicacy. The linework is vibrant and detailed, with soft coloring and cel-shading. The background is a slightly textured white to maintain clarity without distracting from the central character. Only 1 image should be generated.

üî¥ BAD Example (what to avoid)

Show an anime character with a cat on a transparent background.

‚ùå Problems: vague description, multiple unclear elements, forbidden transparent background.
