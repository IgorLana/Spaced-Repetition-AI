  - An action or expression (not just static).

## üõë Don'ts

## ‚úÖ How it should be

The prompt should generate a detailed description, making clear:

- The central element (iconic character or location).
- What it is doing or conveying.
- The surrounding scenery (memorable or symbolic).
- The applied cinematic style (colors, lighting, atmosphere).
- The appropriate background (neutral or true to the universe).

üü¢ GOOD Example (Harry Potter ‚Äì Hogwarts)

Create a single cinematic illustration of Harry Potter standing in front of a moonlit Hogwarts Castle. He should be holding his wand up, with a determined expression and a light wind moving his robes. The style should be realistic, with an epic atmosphere, dramatic lighting in blueish tones, and a strong contrast between light and shadow. The background shows the detailed castle under a starry sky. Only 1 image should be generated.

üî¥ BAD Example

Show a famous character in some random setting.

‚ùå Problems: vague, no reference to a specific movie/series, no atmosphere, no clarity of setting.
